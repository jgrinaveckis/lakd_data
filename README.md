## LAKD (Lietuvos Automobilių Kelių Direkcija) data read

This repo is for reading two datasets provided by LAKD:
* Weather Conditions: (https://eismoinfo.lt/weather-conditions-service, https://data.gov.lt/dataset/keliu-oru-salygu-duomenys)
* Traffic Intensity: (https://eismoinfo.lt/traffic-intensity-service, https://data.gov.lt/dataset/transporto-priemoniu-eismo-duomenys)

Usage is pretty simple - run main.py with/without additional flag ```--update_specific_part```:
* Flag is not provided - both parts (WeatherCondition and TrafficIntensity are updated)
* Flag == **ti**: only TrafficIntensity are updated
* Flag == **wc** - WeatherConditions tables are updated
* Any other values for this flag leads to exit of the script.

Data types for tables can be found under configs folder in dtypes.json file. These are for reference purposes. <br>
Config with all relevant (DB, tables names and URLs) is under config.ini

### Weather Condition

Here we have three (*wc_devices*, *wc_measures*, *wc_warnings*) tables that are related by id fields (device_id in measures/warnings). <br>
Measures/warnings act as fact and devices as dimensional tables. <br>

### Traffic Intensity

Here we have two (*wc_devices*, *wc_measures*) tables that are related by id fields (device_id in measures/warnings). <br>
Measures act as fact and devices as dimensional tables. <br>
